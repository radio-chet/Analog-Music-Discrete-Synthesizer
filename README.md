# Music-Synthesizer
The report contains the block diagram, design, analysis and testing of an audio synthesizer from discrete components in LTspice.
Through the tunability of the modules that we created, we successfully achieved a great
variety in sounds that our synthesizer can create. By adding potentiometers that control the VCF
cut-off frequency & corner peaking, ADSR and AR times & sustain level, wavefolding and
crossfader outputs, the musician has significant control over the sound characteristics. The
synthesizer design met the initial specifications and possible improvements have been
proposed to improve the robustness of the synthesizer.
